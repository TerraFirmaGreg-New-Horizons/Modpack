- Diamond "lock" on ender items now prevents other players from changing the color of your chest and prevents other players from copying colors into an ender bag.
- Now something similar to the mechanics of nutrients in the soil, with some changes, which was present in 1.7.10 TFC. Each plant has a favorite N, P or K nutrient, you can check this by pressing Shift while viewing the respective tooltip. Once the player reaches Adept level in agriculture, pressing shift while holding a hoe and looking at a block will show the nutrient value of that particular block.
  - Mechanics and details:
    - Each crop consumes all of its favorite nutrients from the soil to grow from 0% to maturity.
    - Farmland will passively receive about 3.14% of each nutrient each month of TFC. This means that it takes 32 in-game months to go from 0% to 100%.
      - If, for example, a crop is planted that uses nutrient N, then that patch of soil will not regenerate nutrient N.
        - This allows for a strategy of dividing the land into 3 (or more) parts and rotating crops based on their favorite nutrient each season in temperate regions.
        - In TFC, each crop takes ~4 months to mature.
    - A mature crop will still use nutrients, so make sure you collect them.
    - A dead crop left on a piece of land will cause passive nutrient growth to drop by 20%.
    - Fertilizers are present for each nutrient, which, when used, increase their specific nutritional value by 50%.
      - Item called "Fertilizer" in TFC is now fertilizer for nutrient K, saltpeter is nutrient N, "Fertilizer (P) for nutrient P.
      - Type "fertilizer" into HEI, you can check all three of them.
- Changed the texture of smoke and steam. Now it's like in 1.18
- Fixed barrel gui texture.
- Added energy levels for opening and maintaining gates, by planets.
- Now at the first spawn, a window will appear that allows the player to choose the climate in which he wants to appear when entering the world.
- Enabled compatibility between ProjectRed and OC.
- Replaced the mod on the graves, yes, again, only now your corpse will appear when you die and will contain all the items that you had in your inventory. You can access items by right-clicking a corpse. When you get all the items, the corpse will disappear. After 1 hour, the corpse will turn into a skeleton, indicating that it has existed longer. This will not change the functionality of the corpse.
